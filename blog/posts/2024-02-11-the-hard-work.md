When someone hires you to do hard work, the expectation is that you do the hard work.
People who do hard work frequently will sometimes confuse that expectation and instead believe that they are expected to make the hard work easy.
Those are two separate tasks and are often two different people's jobs.
Being good at doing hard work does not necessitate the work being easy for you, just that you do the work well.
Some jobs are primarily hard work, do not be discouraged by the work not getting easy - that is the point and thats why you get paid what you get paid.
