People tend to underestimate the complexity of work they haven't done before. 
When you are presented with novel kinds of work in your business, it is helpful to try to understand if there are people who have a job doing just (or nearly just) that task.
If there exist entire jobs — or even careers — doing that work, then you should probably pay someone to do that work. 
Or, if you must do it yourself, do the most well-documented, default version of that work. 
Do not seek out the optimized way, or the fastest way, or god forbid try to innovate on that work. 

Some examples:
- Project Management
- Invoicing or billing
- Accounting
