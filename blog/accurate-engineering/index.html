    <h2>Accurate vs. Precision Engineering</h2>
    <article>
      <p>Manufacturing and mechanical engineering companies will often describe their products and services as &quot;High-Precision&quot; which describes that they can manufacture the same product over and over with very little variation.
That is great for machine parts, but a software product should never have to be built twice; and if it does, the second time should be better â€” not identical.
For software, accuracy is far more important.</p>
