    <h1>Sufficient Software</h1>
    <p>
    I am a freelance software product developer working in Elixir, React, and Ionic.
    I've built tools and products for companies working in 3d-printing, aerospace, the gig economy, warehouse management, and lots more. 
    </p>
    <p>
    My approach to product development is to start small and grow products organically alongside their customers. 
    If you think we should work together, email me at <a href="mailto:nick@sufficient.software">nick@sufficient.software</a>.
