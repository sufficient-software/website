        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Upcoming Meeting Indicator</strong> - Menu bar icon
                shows the number of minutes until your next meeting so you know
                how much time you have to wrap up what you're doing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Multiple Calendar Support</strong> - Integrates directly
                with the MacOS calendar accounts, so you have access to all of
                your calendars right away. Plus, hide the ones you don't need
                daily quick access to.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Choose which app to use for video calls</strong> - If
                you don't like using a service's native app for video calls, you
                can choose to open them in your browser instead. Or if you
                prefer a specific browser for some services (Meet in Chrome) but
                others in another (Teams in Safari), you can set that up too.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Configure Working Days/Times</strong> - Set when you are
                working so you only send availability during those times.
            </li>
        </ul>
